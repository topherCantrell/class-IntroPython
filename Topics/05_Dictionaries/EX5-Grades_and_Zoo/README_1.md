# High Marks

Build a dictionary with several students and their grades. For example:
  - Jan : 75
  - Bob : 88
  - Jill : 52
  - Pat : 99
  
Write the `find_highest` function to locate the best grade. Use that
function to print the highest grade (see output below).
  
```python
my_grades = ... # Build your dictionary here

def find_highest(data):
    return 'Tom'
    
highest = find_highest(my_grades)

print ... # Your code here
```

Expected output is something like (whatever you want):

```
Highest grade is 99 made by Pat.
```
