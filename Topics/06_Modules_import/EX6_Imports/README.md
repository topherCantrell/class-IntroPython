# Random

Import the built-in `random` module.

Do a `dir` on the imported module to see what functions are available. Is there one to
return a random number between a and b? Write some tinker code to prove its ranges.

Try generating 1000 random numbers between 1 and 10 and keep a count to see how many of
each number you get.

Experiment with the `random.choice` method.

Experiment with importing only the functions you need. Experiment with pulling them
in `as` some other name.

# Datetime

Import the built-in `datetime` package. Does it bother you there is a module named
`datetime` in the `datetime` package? Is this a problem? This module has a "now" 
method to return the current date. Use "now" to print the current date/time.
