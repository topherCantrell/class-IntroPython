# Introduction to Python

Dewey Layman teaches this at UAH. My advanced course picks up where he leaves off, so I'll document that course content here.

  * Environment and Tools
    - Eclipse PyDev
    - Command line
    - Interactive vs Script Mode

  * Statement and Syntax
    - Naming rules and characters
    - Private starts with "_"
    - Strongly private starts with "__"
    - Language identifier starts and ends with "__"
    - Reserved words
    - Indention instead of braces
    - escaping line feed
    - semicolon for multiple statements on one line
    - single, double, tripple quotes
    - comments    
  
  * (4) Core Data Types and Basic Operators
    - built-in types
    - literals
    - expression operators
    - built-in math functions
    - utility modules (random, math, etc)
    - shortcut assignment    
  
  * (7) Basic String Operations
    - no "character" type ... just strings of one character
    - immutable
    - basic string operations
    - string literals
    - slash n and slash t and many others
    - escape sequences
    - quotes and double quotes
    - len function
    - 'r' strings (good for windows paths)
    - string formatting type codes    
  
  * (8) Lists
    - built-in object
    - lists can contain anything
    - lists are mutable
    - accessed by offset
    - literals
    - operations
  
  * (8) Dictionaries
    - key/value maps
    - position doesn't matter
    - literals
    - basic operations
  
  * (12) Conditions
    - if and elif and else
    - basic syntax    
  
  * (13) Loops
    - while
    - while/else
    - break, continue, pass
    - iterator for-each
  
  * (16) Functions
    - def and lambda
    - global and nonlocal
    - return and yield
    - arguments and returns
    - return statement
  
  * (22, 23, 24) Modules and Packages
    - all the import flavors
    - from
    - __init__.py
  
  * (26 - 31) Classes and OOP
    - classes
  
  * (9) File I/O and Exceptions
    - file open
    - reading
    - writing
    - file operations (open, close, read, etc)
    - try/except
    - try/finally
    - raise and assert
    - try-except-else-finally
