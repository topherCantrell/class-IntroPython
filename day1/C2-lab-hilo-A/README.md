# Code the Hi/Lo Game

The computer thinks of a number between 1 and 100 and prompts the player
to guess it. Print clues after each guess: 'higher' or 'lower'.

For now, use a hardcoded number. We'll look at random numbers in the next session.

How can you enhance the game?
  - Ask for the player's name and use it?
  - Keep a guess-count?
  - High-score?
  - Random wording in hints?
